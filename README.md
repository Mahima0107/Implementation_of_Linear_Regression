# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a simple and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a numeric value based on the relationship between input (independent) variables and a target (dependent) variable.

* In this dataset There are 8 columns and 1300 rows.
* Algorithm Used: Linear Regression
* Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

🔑 Key Features – Linear Regression for Health Insurance Dataset
* The Health Insurance dataset includes several demographic and lifestyle features that significantly impact the insurance charges (our target variable). These features help build a linear regression model capable of predicting cost with a reasonable level of accuracy and interpretability.

🔍 Model Accuracy :
* The Linear Regression model show 100% accuracy (R² = 1.0), indicating that it perfectly explains the variance in the target variable. This suggests a strong linear relationship between features and target.        However, further validation is needed to ensure this is not due to overfitting or data leakage.

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate individual health insurance charges based on factors like age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region. This analysis aims to help insurance providers understand how demographic and lifestyle factors influence cost and assist in pricing policies more accurately.















📌 Conclusion
Linear Regression provides a strong baseline model for predicting health insurance charges.
The model highlights smoking, age, and BMI as the most influential predictors.
This project demonstrates how simple regression models can still provide valuable insights in real-world cost estimation problems.
