# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a simple and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a numeric value based on the relationship between input (independent) variables and a target (dependent) variable.

In this dataset There are 8 columns and 1300 rows.
Algorithm Used: Linear Regression
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate individual health insurance charges based on factors like age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region. This analysis aims to help insurance providers understand how demographic and lifestyle factors influence cost and assist in pricing policies more accurately.















ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
Linear Regression provides a strong baseline model for predicting health insurance charges.
The model highlights smoking, age, and BMI as the most influential predictors.
This project demonstrates how simple regression models can still provide valuable insights in real-world cost estimation problems.
